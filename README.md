# MAMoC-Server
This is the server component of MAMoC, Multisite Adaptive Mobile Computation Offloading Framework to offload compute-intensive tasks from mobile devices to more powerful surrogates including nearby devices, edge devices and remote cloud instances.

The server side of MAMoC contains two components: `mamoc_router` and `mamoc_server`. The router is decoupled and can be hosted separately with the server.
